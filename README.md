Project Title: Comparative Analysis of Hate Speech Detection using Machine Learning Models

Abstract:
Hate speech detection has become a critical area of research due to its implications for online safety and community well-being. In this project, we aim to explore the effectiveness of various machine learning models in detecting hate speech from text data. We will implement and compare different models using popular Python packages such as scikit-learn and NLTK, examining how their performance varies across different implementations.

Objectives:

Implement hate speech detection using Naive Bayes classifier with scikit-learn.
Implement hate speech detection using Naive Bayes classifier with NLTK.
Explore additional machine learning models for hate speech detection, such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest, and Deep Learning models.
Evaluate the performance of each model in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Investigate any discrepancies in results between different implementations and packages.
Provide insights into the strengths and weaknesses of each model and package combination.
Methodology:

Data Collection: Gather a diverse dataset containing text samples labeled as hate speech or non-hate speech.
Preprocessing: Preprocess the text data by tokenization, removing stop words, and performing stemming or lemmatization.
Model Implementation: Implement Naive Bayes classifiers using both scikit-learn and NLTK. Explore other machine learning models for comparison.
Model Training: Train each model on the preprocessed dataset.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of each model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Comparative Analysis: Compare the results obtained from different implementations and packages. Identify any discrepancies and analyze the reasons behind them.
Discussion: Discuss the strengths and weaknesses of each model and package combination. Provide insights into which models are more suitable for hate speech detection tasks.
